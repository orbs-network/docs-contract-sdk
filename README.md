# Orbs Contract SDK

The Orbs smart contract SDK is a framework for building decentralized applications over the Orbs blockchain. These applications are made of smart contracts written in the [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29) programming language.

The three chapters in the documentation cover:

* [Getting started](getting-started/about-smart-contracts.md) - a high level overview of contract development in Orbs
* [Orbs Contracts](orbs-contracts/smart-contracts.md) - how to develop a new contract - a full reference of the Orbs Contract SDK
* [Gamma in Depth](gamma-in-depth/starting-and-stopping-the-server.md) - working with gamma-cli, the Orbs local blockchain implementation

Support for additional programming languages like JavaScript is under way.
