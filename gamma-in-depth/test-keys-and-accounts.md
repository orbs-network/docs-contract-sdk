# Test keys and accounts

## User accounts

When a user sends a transaction to the blockchain, the transaction needs to be signed with the user's private key. A standard user account includes the following details:

* User public key
* User private key
* User address

## Test accounts for Gamma CLI

Gamma CLI simulates transactions for testing contracts and therefore needs a set of demo user accounts.

When Gamma server is first started, Gamma CLI automatically creates 10 testing accounts and saves their details in a JSON file named `orbs-test-keys.json` in the local directory.

{% hint style="danger" %}
These keys are for testing only and should not be used in secure production environments.
{% endhint %}

Every account is assigned a textual ID, from `user1` to `user10` which can be provided as a command line argument to Gamma CLI to specify that a specific account should sign a transaction.

## Generating new test accounts

To replace the keys with a new batch of 10 accounts run in terminal

```text
gamma-cli gen-test-keys
```

This will override `orbs-test-keys.json` with new data.

## Editing account details manually

The JSON format of `orbs-test-keys.json` is straightforward

Feel free to edit the file manually and add your own accounts. "Real-life" accounts are usually created using the [Orbs Client SDK](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-client-sdk-go).

The fields are encoded as follows:

* Textual IDs for every account \(eg. `user2`\) can be changed to any string you prefer
* Key and Address fields are encoded in [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
