# The Orbs Starter Kit

Orbs has prepared a template to use when starting to work on smart contracts.

It is available here: [https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-starter-kit](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-starter-kit)

The kit will set up a project that uses the Contract SDK and Gamma-cli to build a simple contract. It also uses Node.JS to run the application and the Orbs Javascript Client SDK to access the Orbs blockchain \(Gamma\) and perform actions on the contract.

For more information follow the readme.md file in the repo.
